# Causal-Simulation-Impact-of-Cycle-Tracking-on-Recovery-Score-Accuracy-WHOOP-Inspired-
This project simulates a causal inference problem inspired by WHOOP’s work at the intersection of wearable technology, biometric signal processing, and women’s health. It evaluates whether users who log their menstrual cycles experience improved accuracy in recovery score estimates.
